# Job-Seeker
Job Seeker is a job-finding Android application specifically targeting young people and parents who want to share jobs with their children. It provides powerful search engines to help them find jobs. It has a share function that allows users to share a job and a save function to store jobs for later use. The most important aspect is that the listed jobs are trustworthy, with no scams and detailed information, including company names, making it easy for users with no work experience to verify.

## Features
- Use Firebase to implement User Authentication/Authorisation.
- When a user is logged in, load data (from the file(s) and/or Firebase) at regular time intervals, and visualize the same in the App. (e.g., If the main page contains a list of featured products, the user may see an increased number of products; as well as receive notifications from interactions simulated from the data stream).
- Without restarting, the application can be updated synchronously as the remote database (Firebase) is updated. This means that users will be able to see the instant updates from another user/content provider.
- The ability to micro-interact with items/users (e.g. like, block, connect to another user, etc.).
- The ability to ‘follow’ items. There must be a section that presents all the items followed by a user, grouped, and in order.
- The ability to send notifications for interactions (e.g., follow request, product viewed, etc.). A notification must be sent only after a predetermined number of interactions are set [e.g., when ≥2 requests have been received or 2 follow-up requests have been received).
- The ability to share an item with another user via private messages or other channels within the App.
